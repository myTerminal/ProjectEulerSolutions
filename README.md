ProjectEulerSolutions
=====================

Solutions to the ProjectEuler problems I have solved yet

How to run a solution:
----------------------
You can run a particular solution by typing in the following in the console:

    node run 5

In the above example, '5' is the problem number you want the solution to be run for.

Running Tests:
--------------
You can run solution for all the problems at once to see if any of the results are deviating. You can do that by typing the following command:

    npm test
