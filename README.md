Solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=myTerminal) problems I have solved yet

## How to run a solution:

You can run a particular solution by typing in the following in the console:

    node run 5

In the above example, '5' is the problem number you want the solution to be run for.

## Running Tests:

You can run solution for all the problems at once to see if any of the results are deviating. You can do that by typing the following command:

    npm test
