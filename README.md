Solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=myTerminal) problems I have solved yet **[Deprecated]**

> This is my oldest project on GitHub I created to store my solutions during my early years with JavaScript, GitHub, and even Git, and hence does not even remotely depict my coding style. It is one of my least maintained projects and that is on purpose to preserve it as a memory. As a successor to it and in order to practice other programming languages, I created [project-euler-solutions](https://github.com/myTerminal/project-euler-solutions), which I have planned to take forward.

## How to run a solution:

You can run a particular solution by typing in the following in the console:

    node run 5

In the above example, '5' is the problem number you want the solution to be run for.

## Running Tests:

You can run solutions for all the problems at once to see if any of the results are deviating. You can do that by typing the following command:

    npm test
